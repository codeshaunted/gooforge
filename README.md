# Deprecation
The Workd of Goo 2 team has released a beta of their own official level editor, and work on gooforge has stopped.

# gooforge (WIP)
gooforge is a work-in-progress visual editor for World of Goo 2 levels written in C++ using SFML and Dear ImGui. It currently only supports viewing and limited editing.
